<h5>We want you to know we take your privacy very seriously:</h5>

<p>For the duration of this study, we will be logging the amount of time you spend on websites that you add to the extension as procrastination 
    sites. However, we will only log the time spent on each site, nothing more. We will not know what you visited on those pages, only name of 
    the root site.</p>

<p><strong>For example:</strong> The extension logs that you spent 45 seconds on Facebook.com on Tuesday, but absolutely nothing about the content 
    of the Facebook pages you had open. We will later use this data to see if our extension helped you to procrastinate a little less.</p>

<p>In an effort to increase security, we will be tying your data to a User ID (UID) which is a unique number we will use to identify you. 
    No one but the research team will know which UID links to which identity, rendering your data anonymous to anyone else. 
    Your real identity will never be used or mentioned in any of the following research.</p>
